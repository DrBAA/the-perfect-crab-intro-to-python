# Filtering is going through a list and keeping only some of the items,
# typically according to a condition of some kind. This is useful when you only
# want to keep some of the items in your list.

# For example:

# * Filtering a list of products to only items under Â£5
# * Filtering a list of numbers to remove minus numbers
# * Removing 'junk' data from a list

# Here's an example:

# Imagine someone didn't put their age in
raw_ages = [32, 40, None, 1, 32]

clean_ages = [] # This is our accumulator again

for age in raw_ages: # We go through each age
  # We combine a for with an if to remove 'None' items
  if age != None:
    clean_ages.append(age)

print(raw_ages)
print(clean_ages)

# filter for even and odd numbers 
print("A for loop to filter for even and odd numbers")
odd_and_even_numbers = [32, 35, 50, 44, 40, 17, 15, 20, 1, 23]

odd_numbers = []
even_numbers = []

for number in odd_and_even_numbers: # We go through each number
  # We combine a for with an if and else statement to filter odd and even numbers
  if number % 2 != 0:
    odd_numbers.append(number)
  else:
    even_numbers.append(number)

# Sort the numbers
print("odd and even numbers are: ", sorted(odd_and_even_numbers))
print("odd numbers are: ", sorted(odd_numbers))
print("even numbers are: ", sorted(even_numbers))
